# Feature Analyzer Module (FAM)

## Module Overview
### Objective

The module aims to help data analyzers to understand their data better by:

-   identifying data features and understanding each feature nature (data feature type),
-   understanding feature distribution over data observations (central tendency and dispersion),
-   visualizing data features correctly to get more insights (data visualization),
-   and understanding the relation among features and each other (correlation).

::: {.callout-note}
Correlation among features will be discussed in more details in next chapter.
:::

### Output
Defining module output is essential part to identify module functions and input. Suggested FAM module output will be up-to-certain limit an interactive report that displays:

- Data summary (number of features and number of observations)
- Data features info:
  - Features type, properties and statistical summary
  - Features visualization
  
Discussing the UI design of module output will be in @sec-moduleUI

### Input
FAM module will have two different input types:

- Data input: that will be any `R` data.frame object
- Configurations input: that is list of configuration parameters to customize module default behavior and/or look and feel if needed

```


Next sections will discuss what is data in the first place? what are data features? and what is the difference between the data features and data observations? and what are the available features types and how to measure them statistically?

#### Data Definition

Data can be defined as a collection of observations or facts that describe an event or answer a question scientifically in order to make an informative decision later

Examples for that can be:

-   Students grades in certain class/school
-   The trees growth rate for certain forest
-   Goods selling information in certain market

Observations can be collected for one or more features to describe an event such as:

-   Students name, gender, subject, grade, etc..
-   Trees type, name, tall, etc..
-   goods name, manufacture, expiration date, price, etc..

Each feature gives an insight or different look into the data in which leads to an informative decision or answer at the end

#### Data in R

There are multiple data types for storing data in `R` (i.e matrix, tibbles, tables, ...). However, the most commonly used data type is `data.format` and `tibbles` that extends `data.format` and these are the two types that will be used as an input for the module.

On the other hand, data can be loaded into `R` using multiple functions in base `R` (i.e `?read.csv`, `?read.tsv`) or in extended packages (i.e `?readr::read_csv` package) and discussing that in details is beyond this book scope. Lucky us, base R comes with many available datasets in `datasets` base package, in which will be used through out this chapter. To know more about available datasets check `library(help = "datasets")`

Rest of this chapter will discuss module functions and UI in more details while building it step by step

## Module Functions

### Identify Features Data Types

To analyze data features and extract useful insights from it, we need to understand its nature and type to analyze it correctly and since features can be considered data descriptors, they can be anything and have any type. However, we can classify any feature type into two main groups:

-   Complex Feature
-   Simple Feature

Complex feature is any feature that cannot be straight forward measured or got analyzed statistically and would need more special *data processing* and most probably it will be converted to many sub features by its own to be analyzed statistically (i.e YouTube video, binary log files. book text, etc..). Each sub-type of these features would need a very specific and different type of processing (i.e video processing, audio processing, NLP, etc..) and that is beyond the scope of this book.

In contrast, Simple feature is any feature that can be directly classified, measured and got analyzed statistically (i.e height, width, age, class, etc..). This type can classified into three main sub-types:

-   Categorical

-   Discrete

-   Continuous

Check @fig-2_2 for features types summary

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "Features Types"
%%| fig-width: 7
%%| label: fig-2_2
flowchart TD
  A[Feature Type]
  A  --> B[Complex]
  A  --> C[Simple]
  
  B  --> B1[Video]
  B  --> B2[Image]
  B  --> B3[Audio]
  
  C  --> C1[Categorical]
  C  --> C2[Numerical]
  
  C2 --> C21[Discrete]
  C2 --> C22[Continuous]
  C1 --> C11[Nominal]
  C1 --> C12[Ordinal]
```

In next sections, we will discuss these types in more detail and discuss how to analyze them using **FAM** module

#### Categorical Feature

Categorical feature is data that cannot be measured with numbers and have finite number of categories or distinct groups (i.e gender, race, language, etc..), However, it still can take numeric *form* (i.e age groups, weight groups, etc..).

Categorical data can be classified into two sub types:

-   **Nominal** in which categories order is not important and means nothing (i.e gender, nationality, eye color, etc..)
-   **Ordinal** in which categories order is important such as measurements in general (low, middle, high), grades (A, B, C, ..) Days of the week (Saturday, Sunday, ..)

However, as order will not affect statistical measurements, it won't concern us here.

##### Identifying Categorical Feature

Categorical feature can be represented in `R` via datatype `factor` and can be identified easily using `class` method, for example:

```{r}
class(iris$Species)
```

and we can know the unique values by calling `levels` method on `R` factors

```{r}
levels(iris$Species)
```
However, not all categorical values are defined as factors, they can have `character` or `numerical` datatypes for example the following features have a finite number of categories but they are not identified as `factor`:

```{r}
class(mtcars$cyl)
class(letters)
```
In that case, FAM compares the number of unique values against configurable threshold to determine if this feature will be treated as a categorical feature or not. Check @fig-2_3 for identifying categorical feature algorithm

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "Identifying Categorical Feature Algorithm"
%%| fig-width: 4
%%| label: fig-2_3
flowchart TD
  S(start)
  S  --> P1(Check feature using `class` function)
  P1 --> C1{Is it factor?}
  
  C1 --> |Yes| D1[categorical feature]
  D1 --> E(end)
  
  C1 --> |No| C2{"unique values count is
                 greater than
                 categories threshold?"}
  C2 --> |Yes| E3(end)
  C2 --> |No| C3{"unique values count is
                 greater than 1?"}
  C3 --> |No| E2(end)
  C3 --> |Yes| D3[categorical feature]
  D3 --> E2(end)
  
```

#### Numerical Features
By reviewing @fig-2_2, we know that numerical features can either be **Discrete** or **Continuous**

##### Discrete Feature

Discrete feature is a numeric feature with finite and countable number of values between any two values, such as:

-   Store customers count per week day
-   Employees age
-   Weather degrees for a month

##### Continues Feature

Continues feature is a numeric feature with an infinite and uncountable number of values between any two variables, such as:

-   BMI of students in a school
-   Daily rain volume in a certain area during in predefined duration
-   Yearly volume of Nile flow

##### Identifying Numerical Features
Both numerical features can be mapped into `numeric` data type in `R`and to be more specific `Discreate` features can be mapped to `integer` datatype while continuous feature can be mapped to `double` type.

However, that distinction can be tricky in `R` using either `class` or `typeof` functions, check:

```{r}
paste(class(1), class(1.0), class(1L))
paste(typeof(1), typeof(1.0), typeof(1L))
```
So, **FAM** distinguishes between both features by their definition as discrete feature have integer values where continuous feature is otherwise, check @fig-2_4

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "Identifying Numerical Feature Algorithm"
%%| fig-width: 4
%%| label: fig-2_4
flowchart TD
  S(start)
  S  --> C1{is it categorical feature?}
  
  C1 --> |Yes| E(end)
  
  C1 --> |No| C2{is feature Numerical?}
  C2 --> |No| E2(end)
  
  C2 --> |Yes| C3{is feature Integer?}
  
  C3 --> |Yes| D1[Discrete Feature]
  D1 --> E3(end)
  
  C3 --> |No| D2[Continuous Feature]
  D2 --> E3
  
```

### Calculate feature statistical summary
Second **FAM** function is calculating feature statistical summary after its type being identified, review @fig-2_1.

Normally, data collections have hundreds to thousands of observations for its different features, which makes inspecting features observations manually is pointless and waste of time. Hence come the importance of calculating feature statistical summary to understand this amount of data and to extract decision making supporting insights.

In next sections, we will discuss how **FAM** will implement different statistical methods to summarize data and know its dispersion for different features. 

#### Calculate Central Tendency Measures

A measure of central tendency is a feature data *average/center* value. The most common measures of central tendency methods are:

-   The arithmetic mean (numerical feature only)
-   The median (numerical feature only)
-   Quantiles (numerical feature only)
-   The mode

##### Arithmetic Mean

**Arithmetic Mean** is simply the data average as follow:

$$
\bar{x}  = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{x_i}
$$

and it can be calculated using `mean` function in `R`

```{r}
mean(trees$Height)
```

##### Median

Median value is the value that divides feature data into two equal sets. The median calculated differently based on observations count as follow:

-   If count of observations is odd, the median will be the middle value
-   If count of observations is even, the median will be the mean of the middle two values

:::{.callout-tip}
Feature observations need to be ordered before calculating the mean. Lucky us, `R` is doing that for us
:::

$$
    median = \begin{cases} 
              x_{\frac{n+1}{2}}  & \text{ if } n \text{is odd} \\
              \frac{1}{2}(x_{\frac{n}{2}} + x_{\frac{n}{2} + 1}) & \text{otherwise}
          \end{cases}
$$ 

and it can be calculated using `median` function in `R`: Ex1: Median of height of`R` embedded dataset `tree` is:

```{r}
median(trees$Height)
```

::: {.callout-warning}
Mean and Median values happen to the same in the used dataset as it symmetrically distributed around its center, but that is not usually the case
:::

##### Quantiles

If we need to divide data into more partitions than just two then we use quantiles, for example:

-   a *15 %-quantile* divides the data into two parts such that at least **15%** of the values are less than or equal to the quantile and at least **85%** of the values are greater than or equal to the quantile.

Hence, quantiles can take any integer value from *0* to *100* (here it will called **percentiles**) or decimal value between *0* and *1* (here it will called **quintiles**)

Quantiles have special values as follow:

-   *0 %-quantile*: the minimum data value
-   *50 %-quantile*: the median value
-   *100 %-quantile*: the maximum data value

```{r}
quantile(trees$Height)
```

##### Mode

The most frequent value in feature observations called feature *mode*. Hence, the value can be calculated for any feature type.

It cannot be directly calculate with `R`. FAM uses custom algorithm for calculating the mode  check @fig-2_5

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "Calculating Feature Mode"
%%| fig-width: 4
%%| label: fig-2_5
flowchart TD
  S(start)
  S  --> S1[Remove empty values from data]
  S1 --> S2[Extract data unique values]
  S2 --> S3[Calculate each unique value frequency]
  S3 --> S4[Return the highest frequency associated values]
  S4 --> E(end)
  
```

#### Calculate Feature Dispersion

Feature dispersion (or variability) is to know how feature data is spread out, to know if data is squeezed or scattered, to know if the data is homogeneous or heterogeneous.

The most famous methods to calculate dispersion are:

-   Range,
-   Interquartile Range,
-   Variance,
-   and Standard Deviation.

In next subsection, each method will be discussed briefly with an `R` example if applicable

##### Range and Interquartile Range

-   **Range** is the difference between maximum and minimum values in the dataset
-   **Interquartile Range** is the difference between *75th* and *25th* quartiles values

To obtain needed values to calculate both **Range** and **Interquartile Range** using `R, use`summary\` function as follow:

```{r}
summary(trees$Height)
```

##### Variance

Variance is the important and known dispersion value and symbolized as $\sigma^2$ and can be calculated as follow: $$
 \sigma^2 = \sum{\frac{(x_i - \mu)^2}{N}}
$$ where μ is the population mean, $x_i$ is the *ith* element from the population, *N* is the population size, and Σ is just a fancy symbol that means "sum."

To calculate **variance** in `R`, use `var` function as follow

```{r}
var(trees$Height)
```

##### Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is simply the square root of variance and to calculate it in `R`, use `sd` function as follow

```{r}
sd(trees$Height)
sd(trees$Height) == sqrt(var(trees$Height))
```

### Visualize Features

Numerical analysis is very important as discussed in previous section. However, a picture worthies more than a thousand word. Hence, **FAM** presents its third function to summarize feature data in a more easy-to-understand plot using [cavansXpress](https://canvasxpress.org/).

[cavansXpress](https://canvasxpress.org/) can present numerical analysis along with the other visual analysis tools with the ability to switch between different charts without re-coding our chart, in addition to many other on-shelf features that were discussed in chapter 1.

In next sections, the **FAM** module implemented features graphical representations based on feature type

#### Pie Chart

[Pie Chart](https://canvasxpress.org/examples/pie-1.html) is the simplest method to visualize categorical data. It is a circle divided into sectors. Each sector represent a feature relative frequency (upon hovering over plot, both frequency and relative frequency will be shown). Sum of the sectors equal 100%, review @fig-2_6

#### Bar Plot

[Bar Plot](https://canvasxpress.org/examples/bar-1.html) is another method to visualize categorical data, and the most famous. Usually, each category is represented as a bar in the X-axis while bar height represents either category frequency (absolute or relative). The tallest bar is representing the *mode*, review @fig-2_7-1 and @fig-2_7-2

:::{.callout-tip}
If categories count is large, bar plot became so dense and might be hard to digest and Histogram plots can be used instead
:::

#### Histogram

[Histogram](https://canvasxpress.org/examples/histogram-1.html) idea is very similar to [Bar Plot](https://canvasxpress.org/examples/bar-1.html) but for numerical data (continues and discrete).Mainly the data is divided into multiple intervals (bins). Each bin is represented by its own bar. Bar height represents the frequency for the data within that interval

Using [canvasXpress](https://canvasxpress.org), analyzer can control number of bins and/or bin width. Also analyzer can change the bars into [Dot Plot](https://canvasxpress.org/examples/dotplot-1.html) to display *Relative Frequency*, @fig-2_8

#### Density Plot

[Density Plot](https://canvasxpress.org/examples/density-1.html) is another representation for numerical data but with different look and feel as there is no need to partition data artificially into bins. [canvasXpress](https://canvasxpress.org) has many features to control density plot. Also analyzer can show both histogram and density plot in the same plot, review @fig-2_9

One of the best methods to describe numerical feature measure tendency and dispersion is [Boxplot](https://canvasxpress.org/examples/boxplot-1.html).

## Module UI {#sec-moduleUI}

I can only think of a few dozen ways to represent module UI and interactivity with the user, such as:

- Module can generate full data report offline and make it downloadable to user
- Or it can be a shiny page with all features information

In order to make it more easy for us to design out module UI, let us start by how module user (the user shiny app) will interact with it and how it will send required data and configurations to it and how it will embed module output in app UI in general. The most important step is to define UI sequence diagram, then implement the behaviour using any UI arrangements and controls you like, review @fig-2_12.

::: {.callout-note}
That is a simple suggestion for single feature analysis. You implementation could different and definitely will be more awesome

## Excerises

1. Using `periscope2` app that is created in chapter 1, implement your own version of **Feature Analyzer** module, then compare your solution against implemented solution in book site.

1. Integrate `?periscope2::downloadFile` module to your module implementation in order to download all feature statistical summary in one file.

1. In this chapter, we only discussed and implemented **arithmetic mean**. However, there are other statistical mean functions that can be implemented to enrich your FAM module as [Geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean), [Arithmetic–geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic%E2%80%93geometric_mean) or [Cubic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_mean). Pick one and implement one of them
