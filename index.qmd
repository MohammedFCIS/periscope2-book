***Rephrase later***

The proposed book is discussing how to build shiny modules and integrate them as statistical solutions for R shiny data analysis applications.Â 

The book is targeting:

-   R developer who want to learn Shiny Module and to build R packages, as the book will build an R package contains multiple statistical R shiny modules

-   Statisticians who are interested in transforming their knowledge into interactive R applications in which make their work more easy

-   Experienced R users who are seeking to enrich their data analysis application with statistics solutions using rich and interactive shiny and visualisation tools

Based on targeted readers, the book is assuming that readers have:

-   Basic R knowledge (knowing R shiny is a plus but not required)

-   Basic statistical Knowledge (optional but not required)

The book will discuss visual data analysis and shiny modules in new way using:

-   canvasXpress R package that is considered an excellent visual data analysis tools with is rich with many chart types that make data analyst and statisticians life much easy

-   Periscope dashboard to display and show the built shiny modules and how data analyst can build a full functional shiny dashboard using built modules
